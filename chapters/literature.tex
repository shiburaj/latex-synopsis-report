\chapter{Review of Literature}
In this chapter include a critical appraisal of the previous work published in the literature pertaining to the topic of the investigation. Follow the below sample example.

\section{Review of Paper 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Random Forest}


\subsection*{Methodology and Approach}
Smith et al. (2020) employed a Random Forest algorithm for credit card fraud detection, focusing on handling class imbalance through stratified sampling. Their approach involved feature engineering on transaction time, amount, and historical patterns.

\subsection*{Strengths and Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comprehensive feature engineering approach
\item Effective handling of class imbalance
\item High accuracy rates on benchmark dataset
\item Robust against overfitting
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Limitations and Gaps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computational intensity limits real-time application
\item Limited exploration of deep learning alternatives
\item Dataset restricted to European transactions only
\end{itemize}
